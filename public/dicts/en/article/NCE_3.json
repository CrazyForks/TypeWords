    "text": "Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. \nWhen reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. \nHowever, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar. \nThe hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. \nIt immediately ran away when she saw it, \nand experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. \nThe search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. \nWherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. \nPaw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. \nSeveral people complained of \"cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. \nThe experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, \nbut where had it come from? \nAs no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. \nThe hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. \nIt is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.",

You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.' \n'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. \n'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.' \n'That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. \n'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it.' \n'We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar. \"Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'",

    "text": "Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. \nAn American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. \nThe city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. \nHouses--often three storeys high--were built of stone. \nThey had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. \nThe city was equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets. \n\nThe temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. \nIn the most sacred room of temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found. \nEach of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. \nThe body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. It's missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. \nIt was very old and precious even then. \nWhen the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. \nShe stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. \nShe was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. \nDespite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, \nso far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.",
